# The Labyrinth of Kawarigami

## About
This is a game for Global Game Jam 2016, which Rinaldo and Daniel made in Kyoto.

## Building
No build step! This game is vanilla JS and runs pretty regular.

## Running
Point a web server to the root directory and open `index.html` in your web browser.

I usually use the `http-server` package on npm. You can find it [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)

# Playing
This game is played with the keyboard and XInput gamepads plugged into Google Chrome. Xbox 360 and Playstation 4 controllers work particularily well. The minimum number of players required is 2. Sorry if you're alone, we're not that great at making single player games, apparently!

## Contact
Feel free to reach out to Daniel if you have any questions! We'd be keen to talk about it!
